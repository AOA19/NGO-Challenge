# Green Guerillas NGO Challenge Landing Page 

This project was completed for the [SheCodes NGO Landing Page Challenge](https://www.shecodes.io/contests/ngo-landing-page/instructions#instructions). I chose [Green Guerillas](https://www.greenguerillas.org/) as my inspiration for this NGO landing Page. As far as the requirements of this challenge were concerned.

## What I Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Boostrap 
- JavaScript 
- Figma (for the design)
